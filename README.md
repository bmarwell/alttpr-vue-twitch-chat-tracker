## Progress

### NEXT

* react to chat commands (top priority obviously). See [#2](https://github.com/bmhm/alttpr-vue-twitch-chat-tracker/issues/2).
* Update button for another user which will be tracker. See [#3](https://github.com/bmhm/alttpr-vue-twitch-chat-tracker/issues/3).
* Save username, channel, oauth.
* Save item state.

### 2108-08-13
* Reconnect works a little better already.
* emit events on valid commands, so the tracker can react. Was [#1](https://github.com/bmhm/alttpr-vue-twitch-chat-tracker/issues/2).
Already can react to !hud \[bow, boomerang blue, boomerang red, arrows, silvers, laggerang, rederang, boomerang both\].

### 2018-08-10
Twitch integration: You can connect and send !hud commands without anything to happen.

### 2018-08-08
Still no twitch integration, which is following next.

### 2018-08-07
